# Computer Science Crash Course for Python Hackers

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for joining this pre-conference workshop for PyBay 2017.

This will be a whirlwind tour through a number of important computer science topics, designed for Python hackers without a formal CS background. If you can hack out Python code without too much trouble, but don't always know how and why it works (or how you might make it run faster) then I'm sure you'll have learn a lot today and have a great time too!

As you may know, a formal undergraduate education in computer science typically takes 4 years, whereas we will have around 6 hours ðŸ˜³. Even at [Bradfield](https://bradfieldcs.com) where we run accelerated computer science courses for practicing software engineers, we still take a month on each topic. So, today should give you an overall map of the terrain of CS, and hopefully whet your appetite for learning much more!

I'd also like to point out that it's always hard to calibrate the difficulty of exercises to a large group, particularly when we don't know how much background you have coming in. For that reason, we've erred on the side of having too many exercises, with enough stretch goals that even the most experienced participants still have plenty to work through. That means that the person with the median experience level here might feel like they're falling behind! Please don't worry, my expectation is that we won't be able to cover all the content or complete all of the exercises. Hopefully everything is well enough described that you can finish things off at home if you'd like to do so.

## Optimistic structure for the day

If we _do_ manage to get through everything, the day will look roughly like this:

* Introductions and expectations
* Discuss binary representations of data
* Exercise 1 - convert a bitmap file to grayscale
* Discuss algorithm analysis and linear data structures
* Exercise 2 - implement an efficient queue
* Discuss hashing and hashmaps
* Exercise 3 - implement `dict`
* Discuss the layered network model
* Exercise 4 - parse a network packet
* Discuss compiler/interpreter architecture
* Exercise 5 - write a simple Python bytecode interpreter

We'll take short short breaks between each exercise, and make one of those a longer break for lunch, depending on progress.

## Keeping in touch

If you'd like to keep working on the exercises after today, feel free to email questions to [oz@bradfieldcs.com](mailto:oz@bradfieldcs.com). To keep in touch about future workshops and courses, join our weekly-ish newsletter, [Bradfield Beeps](http://eepurl.com/ccYC39).
